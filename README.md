The simulation consists of four key entities: Riders, drivers, the dispatcher, and the monitor. Riders request
rides from their current location to a destination. Drivers drive to pick up and drop off riders. The dispatcher
receives and satisfies requests from drivers for a rider, and from riders for a driver. The monitor keeps track
of activities in the simulation, and when asked, generates a report of what happened during the simulation.
